# MSU-IIT IDS Teacher Efficiency Rating

The IDS Teacher Efficiency Rating is a tool that allows students and teachers to provide feedback on the performance of their educators. This can be done through a rating system, where students and teachers can rate their subject teachers or colleagues on various dimensions of teaching effectiveness, such as knowledge of the subject matter, ability to engage students, and communication skills. This can be helpful for teachers to identify areas of strength and weakness and make improvements in their teaching practices. The IDS Teacher Efficiency Rating used by school administrators to evaluate the overall performance of their teachers and to make decisions about promotions, professional development, and other matters related to teacher performance.

### Personal Note
The IDS Teacher Efficiency Rating system was developed by me with five other classmates during my senior high school as part of an immersion project. I decided to continued to work on the system as I went to college, using what I learned each year to redesign, rethink, and refactor it. As I enter the corporate world, I plan to pursue developing the system and improving upon it.

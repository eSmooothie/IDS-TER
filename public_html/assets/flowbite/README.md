## Documentation

## Getting started

Flowbite can be included as a plugin into an existing Tailwind CSS project and it is supposed to help you build websites faster by having a set of web components to work with built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

ðŸ‘‰ [See all components](https://flowbite.com/docs/components/alerts/) <br>

### Require via NPM

Make sure that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> installed. 

1. Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @themesberg/flowbite
```

2. Require Flowbite as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {

    plugins: [
        require('@themesberg/flowbite/plugin')
    ]

}
```

3. Include the main JavaScript file to make interactive elements work:

```html
<script src="../path/to/@themesberg/flowbite/dist/flowbite.bundle.js"></script>
```

If you use Webpack or other bundlers you can also import it like this:

```javascript
import '@themesberg/flowbite';
```

### Include via CDN

The quickest way to get started working with FlowBite is to simply include the CSS and JavaScript into your project via CDN.

Require the following minified stylesheet inside the `head` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@themesberg/flowbite@latest/dist/flowbite.min.css" />
```

And include the following javascript file before the end of the `body` element:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@themesberg/flowbite@latest/dist/flowbite.bundle.js"></script>
```
